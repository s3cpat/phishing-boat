            <h2>About Phishing Boat</h2>
            <p>Phishing Boat is a phishing analysis tool programmed in Python and Docker. <br />
                It was created by a student at the Pennsylvania State University. </p>
            <p>Using existing Python libraries for parsing both Outlook/Exchange format emails (MSG) and Internet
                Message Format (EML),
                this tool breaks down an email and performs simple header and IOC analysis. This completes repetitive
                analysis tasks
                to free up a SOC analyst's time and allow the analyst to focus on more pressing matters.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project uses Docker for two reasons:
            </p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Sandboxing/Isolation</li>
                    <li>Reproducibility</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                This allows each analyst to spin up an instance of Phishing Boat on their own machine, or to create one
                central instance.
            </p>
