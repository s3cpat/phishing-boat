                <h2>About Phishing Boat</h2>
                <p>Phishing Boat is a phishing analysis tool programmed in Python and Docker. <br/>
                It was created by students at the Pennsylvania State University. </p>
                <p>Using existing Python libraries for parsing both Outlook/Exchange format emails (MSG) and Internet Message Format (EML), 
                    this tool breaks down an email and performs simple header and IOC analysis.  This completes repetitive analysis tasks 
                    to free up a SOC analyst's time and allow the analyst to focus on more pressing matters.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project uses Docker for two reasons:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Sandboxing/Isolation</li>
                        <li>Reproducibility</li>
                    </ol>
                    This allows each analyst to spin up an instance of Phishing Boat on their own machine, or to create one central instance.  
                </p>
